### Fixes
- Fixed an incorrect face rotation when using the rear camera feed.
- Correctly report the supported number of simultaneously tracked faces. Previously, [ARFaceManager.supportedFaceCount](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@3.0/api/UnityEngine.XR.ARFoundation.ARFaceManager.html#UnityEngine_XR_ARFoundation_ARFaceManager_supportedFaceCount) would always return the supported number of tracked faces in front-facing camera mode. The value reported now depends on the current configuration since, in rear-facing camera mode, the number could be different.

### This is the first release of *ARKit Face Tracking*.

Provides runtime support for Face Tracking on ARKit. This is a separate package from com.unity.xr.arkit due to security concerns: apps that contain certain face-tracking related symbols in their compiled binaries will fail App Store validation unless additional documentation explaning the uses of face tracking are documented. This allows face tracking support to be added separately.
