### This is the first release of *ARKit Face Tracking*.

Provides runtime support for Face Tracking on ARKit. This is a separate package from com.unity.xr.arkit due to security concerns: apps that contain certain face-tracking related symbols in their compiled binaries will fail App Store validation unless additional documentation explaning the uses of face tracking are documented. This allows face tracking support to be added separately.
