# About ARKit Face Tracking

This package provides face tracking support to augment the [ARKit XR Plugin](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arkit@4.0).

## Installing ARKit Face Tracking

To install this package, follow the instructions in the [Package Manager documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.package-manager-ui@latest/index.html).

## Using ARKit Face Tracking

This package implements the face tracking subsystem defined in the [AR Subsystems](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arsubsystems@4.0) package. Refer to that package's documentation for instructions on how to use basic face tracking.

This package also provides additional, ARkit-specific face tracking functionality. ARKit provides a series of "blendshapes" to describe different features of a face. Each blendshape is modulated from 0..1. For example, there is a blendshape location describing how closed the mouth is.

## Front facing camera

Face tracking requires the use of the front-facing (selfie) camera. When the front-facing camera is active, other tracking subsystems (for example, plane tracking or image tracking) aren't available. Likewise, if the rear-facing camera is active, face tracking isn't available. If you `Start` other, conflicting subsystems (subsystems that require the rear-facing camera), the ARKit package could decide to use the rear-facing camera instead. Therefore, to use face tracking on ARKit, you should `Stop` any other subsystems which might use the rear-facing camera. These include:

* [Plane tracking](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arsubsystems@4.0/manual/plane-subsystem.html)
* [Image tracking](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arsubsystems@4.0/manual/image-tracking.html)
* [Object tracking](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arsubsystems@4.0/manual/object-tracking.html)
