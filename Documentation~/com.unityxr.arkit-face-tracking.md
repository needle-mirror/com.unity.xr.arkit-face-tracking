# About ARKit Face Tracking

*The Timeline Examples package includes examples of Timeline assets, Timeline Instances, animation, GameObjects, and scripts that illustrate how to use Unity's Timeline. For more information, see [ Unity's Timeline](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/TimelineSection.html) in the [Unity Manual](https://docs.unity3d.com). For licensing and usage, see Package Licensing.*

# Installing ARKit Face Tracking

To install this package, follow the instructions in the [Package Manager documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.package-manager-ui@latest/index.html).

# Using ARKit Face Tracking

This package implements the face tracking subsystem defined in the [AR Subsystems](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arsubsystems@2.1) package. Refer to that package's documentation for instructions on how to use basic face tracking.

This package also provides additional, ARkit-specific face tracking functionality. ARKit provides a series of "blendshapes" to describe different features of a face. Each blendshape is modulated from 0..1. For example, there is a blendshape location describing how closed the mouth is.

## Front Facing Camera

Face tracking requires the use of the front-facing (selfie) camera. When the front-facing camera is active, other tracking subsystems (e.g., plane tracking, image tracking) will not be available. Likewise, if the rear-facing camera is active, face tracking will not be available. If you `Start` other, conflicting subsystems (subsystems that require the rear-facing camera), the ARKit package may decide to use the rear-facing camera instead. Therefore, to use face tracking on ARKit, you should `Stop` any other subsystems which may require the rear-facing camera. These include

* [Plane Tracking](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arsubsystems@2.1/manual/plane-subsystem.html)
* [Image Tracking](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arsubsystems@2.1/manual/image-tracking.html)
* [Object Tracking](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arsubsystems@2.1/manual/object-tracking.html)
